mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the values in EBX, ECX*4, and 0x10.  The problem is that if the value in ECX is very large, the calculation could overflow, leading to an access violation or unexpected behavior.  This is particularly true in 32-bit assembly where the registers have a limited size.
